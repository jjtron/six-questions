This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## My Notes

Clone a fresh copy from github.

Replace the modified Datepicker.js, in this location, . . .
    /node_modules/date-picker-nextjs/dist/components/Datepicker.js

with the one found in this location, . . .
    /documents/Datepicker.js

immediately after npm install, before first time compile,
so that its modifications get cached, or else it is unalterable 
afterward.

Then, create a /node_modules/@types/date-picker-nextjs/index.d.ts file.
Use the terminal.
The contents of the file should be as follows . . .
    declare module 'date-picker-nextjs';



## Getting Started notes that come with app creation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
